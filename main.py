Below is a complete Python program for an eco-tracking tool named "Eco-Track" designed to assist small to medium-sized businesses in monitoring and reducing their carbon footprints. This program includes basic functionalities for inputting emissions data, calculating the carbon footprint, and suggesting reduction strategies. It also incorporates error handling and comments to help understand the code.

### Key Features:
1. **Add Emissions Data**: Users can add emission values for different categories such as transport, electricity, waste, etc.
2. **Calculate Carbon Footprint**: Computes the total emissions based on the user inputs.
3. **Suggest Reduction Strategies**: Provides suggestions for reducing emissions based on the categories with the highest emissions.
4. **Error Handling**: Includes checks for negative values and invalid format entries and handles them gracefully.
5. **Logging**: Uses logging to keep track of the application's operations and errors.
